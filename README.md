## Navigation Bar

### Key Functionalities:
- **Logo & Logo Positioning**: The logo is placed on the left and is centered vertically. For larger screens, the logo is aligned with a left margin of 23% for visual balance.
- **Search Bar**: Positioned next to the logo, it expands to take 30% of the available space, with a search icon positioned inside the input box.
- **Right Menu**: Contains user-related functionalities like login, cart, and a dropdown for additional options.
  - The login button is styled with a solid border and color contrast to stand out.
  - The cart icon is interactive and scales on hover.

#### Responsive Design:
- On smaller screens (below 1024px), the logo and search bar are adjusted for better space management.
- At max-width: 768px, the navigation bar items are stacked vertically, and the logo is centered.

```css
.nav-bar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## Search Section:
## Key Functionalities:
- **Search Box:** The input box takes up the full width of its container, with padding for the text and a search icon inside.
- **Search Icon:** Positioned absolutely within the input box, allowing users to click it for search functionality.
## Features:
- The search bar adjusts to the screen width and stays interactive for users to type in queries.
```css
.search-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
.search-box {
  padding-right: 40px; /* Space for search icon */
}
.search-icon {
  position: absolute;
  right: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
## Product and Deals Section
## Key Functionalities:
- Deals Container: This section contains featured products and a scrolling feature for the product cards.
- Product Cards: Each card displays an image, name, description, and discount. Hovering over a product card enlarges it.
- Clock Timer: Displays a countdown timer next to the deal header for urgency.
## Responsive Design:
- On smaller screens, the product cards resize to fit comfortably, ensuring that the layout remains clean and readable.
```css

.product-card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Enlarges product on hover */
}
```
## Category Section
## Key Functionalities:
- Category Items: Displays categories with images and names. Each category is clickable, providing navigation.
- Hover Effects: The category image and name scale when hovered over for visual feedback.
## Responsive Design:
- On smaller screens, the category items adjust their width, and the font size reduces slightly for better readability.
```css
.cat-item:hover img {
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
```
## Dropdown Menu
## Key Functionalities:
- Dropdown: A menu that becomes visible when hovering over the more options button. The menu items change color when hovered.
- Smooth Transition: The arrow on the button rotates when hovered to indicate that the dropdown can be expanded.
```css
.dropdown:hover .dropdown-content {
  display: block; /* Shows the dropdown */
}
.more-btn:hover i {
  transform: rotate(180deg); /* Rotates the icon */
}
```
## Ad Banner
## Key Functionalities:
- Ad Banner: Positioned to the side of the product and deals section, this section can display an advertisement or promotion.
- Hover Effect: The banner slightly scales up when hovered, giving it a dynamic effect.
## Responsive Design:
- On mobile devices, the ad banner takes up the full width and is stacked below the main content.
```css
.ad-banner:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Scales the banner on hover */
}
```
## New Section
## Key Functionalities:
- New Content Section: Displays a new section with a title, description, and a button to view more. It also features a background color, padding, and a border-radius for styling.
- View All Button: Positioned to the right, providing a call to action for users to explore more content.
```css
.new-section {
  width: 70%;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
.view-all-btn:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3; /* Changes color on hover */
}
```
## Responsive Design
## Key Functionalities:
- Flexibility and Fluid Layout: The layout switches between flex and grid for various sections to optimize space. Elements like product cards, categories, and buttons adjust their size based on screen width.
- Breakpoint Adjustments: Specific breakpoints for tablet (1024px) and mobile (768px and 480px) ensure that the content remains legible and properly aligned on all screen sizes.
```css
@media (max-width: 1024px) {
  .product-card {
    width: 220px; /* Smaller cards for tablet */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .nav-bar {
    flex-direction: column; /* Stacked layout for mobile */
  }
  .image-container {
    flex-direction: column; /* Vertical layout for products */
  }
}
```
